### Task 1: authentication
In given app authentication is implemented via Amazon Cognito User Pool and OAuth 2.0 protocol. User authenticates with account of application ("Unicorn Resource server") or creates new account then authenticate. After authentication, third party services can apply given service's account for authorization in their applications and use account's data indicated in scope. 

Once the user is authenticated, the client application receives an identity and access token (JWT). Further, information from JWT uses in authorization.

### Task 2: authorization
The authorization in this app is implemented using the Amazon Lambda function. When the call received by Amazon API Gateway, it goes to the "Custom authorizer" Lambda Function, which gives the policy, based on the JWT access token and context of call. Then the needed query to the DynamoDB is made with given policy.

### Task 3: assessment on the authorization and authentication
The overall structure seems good, but there is no protection against the BruteForce (both to the Cognito User Pool and API Gateway). Such policy as requests limit can fix it.

Amazon Cognito User Pool supports authorization code grant, implicit, and client credentials grants for OAuth, however as indicated in project's description and scheme, in given application implicit grant flow is implemented for simplicity. In implicit grant flow client receives access token directly and this is only safe in browser environment (where it's not possible to intercept for any intermediary server/routers). However, in given scheme, third-party application services will be used as well which leads to probable leakage of access token. Thus it's recommended to use authorization code grant flow as it uses additional one-time-use authorization code which is bundled with client secret, so that approach allows to pass access token safely, since client secret is not exposed to network.

# Serverless Hotdog Detector

This example shows you how to build a [serverless](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/#getstarted) [hotdog detecting app](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACmydtFDTGs) on AWS using [Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/), [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), and [Amazon Rekognition](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/).

This example is intended to integrate with [Slack](https://slack.com/) as the application frontend but could easily be modified to work with your own web or mobile application frontend.

This repository contains sample code the Lambda function depicted in the diagram below as well as an [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) template for creating the function and related resources.

To see some of the other real-world examples of Rekognition in action check out the [Image Recognition and Processing Backend Serverless reference architecture](https://github.com/awslabs/lambda-refarch-imagerecognition)

![testing of example gif](images/TestingExample.gif)

## Walkthrough of the Architecture
1. A user posts a message containing the image to perform hotdog detection on in a Slack channel monitored by the chat app.
1. Slack posts the message to an Amazon API Gateway API for the chat app.
1. The API triggers an invocation of the chat app Lambda function which performs the following:
  1. Amazon Rekognitionâ€™s image recognition and labelling feature scans the image and returns a list of detected labels.
  1. The list of labels is checked for those corresponding to hotdogs to determine if the image contained a hotdog.
  1. A message is posted to the chat channel detailing whether the image was a hotdog or not.

## Running the Example
### Preparing Slack
First make sure you're logged in to Slack, then follow these instructions to prep your app:
1. [Create an app](https://api.slack.com/apps?new_app=1) ([Documentation](https://api.slack.com/slack-apps#creating_apps))
1. From the `Basic Information` tab under `Settings` take note of the `Verification Token` as it will be required later
1. Navigate to the `OAuth & Permissions` tab under `Features`
1. Under the `Permissions Scopes` section add the following permission scopes
    * channels:history
    * chat:write:bot
    * files:read
    * files:write:user
1. Click `Save Changes`
1. Click `Install App to Team` then `Authorize` then note the `OAuth Access Token` as it will be required later

### Launching the App Backend on AWS
#### Option 1: Launch from Serverless Application Repository
This app can be launched into any region that supports the underlying services from the [Serverless Application Repository](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/serverlessrepo/) using the instructions below:

1. Navigate to the [application details page](https://serverlessrepo.aws.amazon.com/applications/arn:aws:serverlessrepo:us-east-1:426111819794:applications~hotdog-detector) for the app.
1. Click `Deploy`
1. From the region dropdown in the top right ensure you have the desired region to deploy into selected
1. Input the appropriate application parameters under `Configure application parameters`
1. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click `Deploy` to deploy the chatbot

#### Option 2: Launch the CloudFormation Template Manually 
If you would like to deploy the template manually, you need a S3 bucket in the target region, and then package the Lambda functions into that S3 bucket by using the `aws cloudformation package` utility.

Set environment variables for later commands to use:

```bash
S3BUCKET=[REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_BUCKET]
REGION=[REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_REGION]
STACKNAME=[REPLACE_WITH_DESIRED_NAME]
VTOKEN=[REPLACE_WITH_VERIFICATION_TOKEN]
ATOKEN=[REPLACE_WITH_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN]
```

Then go to the `cloudformation` folder and use the `aws cloudformation package` utility

```bash
cd cloudformation

aws cloudformation package --region $REGION --s3-bucket $S3BUCKET --template hotdog_detector.serverless.yaml --output-template-file hotdog_detector.output.yaml
```
Last, deploy the stack with the resulting yaml (`hotdog_detector.output.yaml`) through the CloudFormation Console or command line:

```bash
aws cloudformation deploy --region $REGION --template-file hotdog_detector.output.yaml --stack-name $STACKNAME --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM --parameter-overrides VerificationToken=$VTOKEN AccessToken=$ATOKEN
```

### Finalize Slack Event Subscription
1. Navigate to the created stack in the CloudFormation console and note the value for the `RequestURL` output from the created stack as it will be required later
1. Return to the Slack app settings page for the Slack app created earlier
1. Navigate to the `Event Subscriptions` tab under `Features` and enable events
1. In the `Request URL` field enter the `RequestURL` value noted earlier
1. Click `Add Workspace Event` and select `message.channels`
1. Click `Save Changes`


## Testing the Example
To test the example open your Slack app and navigate to a channel for the team you configured the Slack app on, then try uploading pictures of different foods to see the app in action.


## Cleaning Up the Stack Resources

To remove all resources created by this example, do the following:

1. Delete the CloudFormation stack.
1. Delete the CloudWatch log groups associated with each Lambda function created by the CloudFormation stack.

## CloudFormation Template Resources
The following sections explain all of the resources created by the CloudFormation template provided with this example.

### AWS Lambda
- **HotdogDetectorFunction** - Lambda function that validates incoming Slack event messages, checks them for images containing explicit content, and orchestrates the removal of images found to contain explicit content from Slack.
- **HotdogDetectorFunctionHotdogDetectorAPIPostPermissionTest** - Implicitly created Lambda permission, allows API Gateway Test stage to call Lambda function.
- **HotdogDetectorFunctionHotdogDetectorAPIPostPermissionProd** - Implicitly created Lambda permission, allows API Gateway Prod stage to call Lambda function.

### AWS IAM
- **HotdogDetectorFunctionRole** - Implicitly created IAM Role with policy that allows Lambda function to invoke "rekognition:DetectLabels" and "rekognition:DetectModerationLabels" API calls and write log messages to CloudWatch Logs.

### Amazon API Gateway
- **HotdogDetectorAPI:** - API for hotdog detector app
- **HotdogDetectorAPIProdStage** - Implicitly created production stage for API
- **HotdogDetectorAPIDeploymentXXXXXXXXX** - Implicitly created deployment for production stage of API
